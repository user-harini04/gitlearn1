Subhas Chandra Bose arrived in India in July 1921, seeking an interview with Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the non-cooperation movement. Their meeting highlighted fundamental differences in ideology; while Bose favored militant approaches to anti-colonialism, Gandhi was committed to non-violence. Bose found a more sympathetic mentor in C. R. Das, which propelled him into active politics, where he founded the newspaper Swaraj, became president of the Indian Youth Congress, and worked within the Indian National Congress (INC) for nearly two decades. He organized the Congress Volunteer Corps, clashing with Gandhi over methods and ideology. By 1939, Bose emerged as a national leader advocating for unqualified Swaraj and socialism, but internal conflicts with Gandhi led to his resignation as INC president. He later established the All India Forward Bloc, aiming to consolidate leftist politics in India. Throughout the opposition to British rule intensified during World War II, leading to mass protests and his imprisonment by the British authorities.</i>

<h3 style="color:yellow;"><u>IDEOLOGY:</u></h1>
<p>
<b>authoritarianism </b><br>
Subhas Chandra Bose believed that authoritarianism could facilitate the liberation and reconstruction of Indian society,<br> admiring the methods seen in Italy and Germany during the 1930s. <br>After becoming marginalized in the Congress, he allied with fascist regimes against the British, <br>advocating for a strong central government with dictatorial powers.<br> Initially a proponent of democracy, he later concluded that it was insufficient to address India's poverty and <br>social inequalities, favoring a socialist state akin to Soviet Russia. 
<br>
<p>
<b>anti-semitism:</b><br>
Before World War II, Subhas Chandra Bose opposed granting Jewish refugees asylum in India, despite denouncing Nazi racial policies in 1938.<br> In December of that year, the Congress criticized German anti-Semitism, but only Bose rejected this stance.<br> By 1942, he controversially claimed that Indians were true Aryans and suggested anti-Semitism was part of the <br>Indian liberation movement due to perceived Jewish support for British exploitation.<br> This prompted the Jewish Chronicle to label him "India's anti-Jewish Quisling." <br>Historian Roman Hayes highlights the ethical dilemmas surrounding Bose's legacy,<br> noting his lack of concern for the millions who suffered in Nazi concentration camps, questioning<br> <h3 style="color:yellow;"><u>INSPIRATION:</u></h1>
<li>Bhagavad Gita had an impact on him, and he saw it as a source of inspiration for the fight against the British.<br> From a young age, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was highly affected by the Universalist and nationalistic ideas of Swami Vivekanand</li><br>
<li>He was drawn to the ideas of socialism and communism when he was a member of the Congress party. <br>However,<br> he thought it would succeed in India if National Socialism and Communism were to be combined. He favoured gender equality, secularism, and other liberal ideologies</li>

Legacy:
words "Jai Hind" have become a national rallying call. 
Bose' defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians,<br>however Imperial Japan left a legacy fraught with <br>authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure
